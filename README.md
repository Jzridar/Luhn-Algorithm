UserExperience(UX) Designers:

User Experience design is the process design team use to create products that provide meaningful and relevant experience to users that is how a user feel about interacting with a product,systerm or service.

A UX Designer's job is to map out how a product should look, feel, work etc to maximize the UX of the product

Unlike User Interface (UI) design that primarily focuses on the look of a product, the goal of a UX design considers the look, feel, and usability of a product.

The goal of UX designers is to create products that are:
1.Useful: Helps the user to accomplish a task easily.The task could vary from a simple task like sending a hello message to a harder task like planning the schedule for the whole week.

2.Usable:Easy of use for every single person irrespective of the ability and experience.Though the product is beautiful,it can be eaily get abandoned if its hard for the users to figure out how to use it.

3.Enjoyable:It should bring joy and excitement to the users.Accomplishing a task is not enough for a product.It should also be delightful for the users to use.

4.Equitable: Useful to people with diverse backgrounds.In UX design they make sure that the products are equitable by ensuring they are accessible and inclusive

It uses tools like Figma to create high fidelity designs and pass them to us the Front End developers to develop products that meets the specifications outlined.

DevOps engineer:
A DevOps engineer introduces processes, tools, and methodologies to balance needs throughout the software development life cycle, from coding and deployment, to maintenance and updates.

DevOps engineer do?
DevOps engineers reduce that complexity, closing the gap between actions needed to quickly change an application, and the tasks that maintain its reliability.

Development teams and IT operations teams can have different skills and different goals. Developers want to introduce new features to an application, while operations teams want to preserve the stability of an application once it is released. 

DevOps is all about the unification and automation of processes, and DevOps engineers are instrumental in combining code, application maintenance, and application management. All of these tasks rely on understanding not only development life cycles, but DevOps culture, and its philosophy, practices, and tools. 

DevOps usually involved the following:

1.Automating the deployment of a project (Continuous Deployment)

2.Automating the test of a project (Continuous Integration)

3.Containerizing Applications for easy replication (Docker)

4.Automating the replication and removing of active containers (Kubernetes)

5.Automating the provisioning of cloud infrastructure (Terraform)

Essentially a DevOps engineer takes the app the developers made and make sure it's bug free and runs well for users.

In simple words the apps start with the Ux Designers, get built by Software Engineers (by us), passed over to Dev Ops Engineers to be deployed and scaled etc.
